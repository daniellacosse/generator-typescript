# @daniellacosse/generator-typescript

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40daniellacosse%2Fgenerator-typescript.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40daniellacosse2Fgenerator-typescript)

## installation

> before you get started, you'll need to install `homebrew`: [ [mac](https://brew.sh/) | [linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) ]

```bash
brew install yarn
yarn global add yo @daniellacosse/generator-typescript
```

## creating a project

feel free to add this to your `~/.bash_profile` or just run the commands manually:

```sh
dts() {
  read $MY_PROJECT_NAME

  # the terminal will wait for you to type in the name of your project. please use `pascal-case`

  mkdir $MY_PROJECT_NAME
  cd $MY_PROJECT_NAME

  # the magic part üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  yo @daniellacosse/typescript
  
  # run `make` as a smoke test
  make
}
```

this will generate the boilerplate. now the hard part - setting up **github** and **circleci**

### pushing to github

first, click the `+` in the top right.

![step 1](tutorial-images/step-1.png)

> NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è: the name of your repository must match the name of your project/project folder

now, you can push your project:

```
git push -u origin master
```

refresh the page, and you should see it

---

next, there are a couple configuration steps to take care of in `github` that we unfortunately have to do manually. first, it's preferred to only allow squashed commits

> this is important because it keeps the commit chain short, the history good, and increases the chance that each commit on the main branch is atomic and transportable

go to `Settings`:

![step 2](tutorial-images/step-2.png)

and then scroll down to select these options:

![step 3](tutorial-images/step-3.png)

secondly, we should set some branch restrictions on `master`. this is to encourage good behavior and best practices.

scroll back up and click the `Branches` pill in the sidebar:

![step 4](tutorial-images/step-4.png)

you should see an option to create a rule:

![step 5](tutorial-images/step-5.png)

your new rule should default to `master`. at minimum, we should enforce our `circleci` checks. this means that, in order to be able to merge our code, that code will need to pass whatever tests we select here:

![step 6](tutorial-images/step-6.png)

if you don't see anything, skip to the [authorizing circleci]() section and then come back here.

> NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è: unfortunately, you shouldn't enforce these restrictions for administrators. circleci needs to be able to push to the branch directly for this setup to work. **to be pure, with a paid github account you can create a special group and put the circleci bot in it, though you'll have to set that up yourself**


### authorizing circleci

almost done. we just need to get circleci running. [make sure you have an account.](https://circleci.com/)

at circleci.com, go to `Add Projects`

![step 7](tutorial-images/step-7.png)

then `Set Up project`

![step 8](tutorial-images/step-8.png)

we've already got a config, so you can just scroll down to `Start building`

![step 9](tutorial-images/step-9.png)

then, in the `Jobs` tab you'll need to click on the ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to your project name and scroll down to the `Checkout SSH Keys` tab:

![step 10](tutorial-images/step-10.png)

here you can add your üîë user keys to `circleci`. `circleci` will then have access to do it needs to do everything for you.

![step 11](tutorial-images/step-11.png)

that's it! if you have any questions, please create an [issue]().
